\chapter{Custom software}

The following software was developed for the present work:

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2 mm]
	\item \textbf{DrSwine} (\url{https://github.com/0/DrSwine}) is a minimal implementation of LePIGS written in the Racket programming language.
		Its focus is on the manipulation of paths as concrete objects rather than as manifestations of particles, allowing direct access to arbitrary sectors.
	\item \textbf{pathintmatmult} (\url{https://github.com/0/pathintmatmult}) is a Python 3 package for calculating wavefunctions and densities using path integrals (either finite temperature or ground state).
		Since it uses numerical matrix multiplication rather than Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics, it is limited to very low-dimensional systems.
		However, it provides numerically exact results, with systematic error but no statistical error.
	\item \textbf{realtimepork} (\url{https://github.com/0/realtimepork}) is a Python 3 package for finding real-time correlation functions for 1-dimensional systems using the approximate Herman--Kluk real-time propagator and PIGS ground state wavefunctions.
		It takes care of propagating the classical trajectories and combining the results using numerical integration.
		Some of the computation may be performed on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), leading to a significant increase in speed.
\end{itemize}
