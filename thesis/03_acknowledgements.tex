\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I am extremely grateful to Pierre-Nicholas Roy for being an excellent supervisor.
The comments and suggestions from my committee, consisting of Marcel Nooijen and Roger Melko, have been a useful part of my learning process.

The Theoretical Chemistry group at the University of Waterloo is a superb group of people, and they have made my last two years nothing if not fun and rewarding.

The many discussions with Chris Herdman about the details of Path Integral Monte Carlo, entanglement entropy, and the coupled harmonic oscillator system have been very valuable.

Finally, this thesis would be impossible (or at least entirely different) without MMTK and its support for path integrals.
Many thanks to Konrad Hinsen, Chris Ing, and Steve Constable!
