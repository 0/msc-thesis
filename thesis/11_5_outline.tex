\section{Thesis outline}

In the present work, we are concerned with two fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics: entanglement and time evolution.
For the former, we look at the RÃ©nyi entropy as a measure of entanglement in quantum systems in \cref{chap:renyi}.
Specifically, we implement a method for obtaining particle entanglement in molecular systems.
For the latter, we investigate a novel approach to semiclassical IVR for real-time correlation functions in \cref{chap:semiclassical}.
The novelty involves using stochastic sampling of ground state wavefunctions in order to find ground-state correlation functions.
In \cref{chap:conclusion}, we summarize the results and provide a brief outlook on future work.
Finally, \cref{chap:bonus} contains some miscellaneous results that are not directly related to the rest of the thesis.
